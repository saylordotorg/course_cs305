Course Syllabus for "CS305: Web Development"
--------------------------------------------

The World Wide Web (WWW) has become the primary means by which we
conduct searches and perform billing transactions—events that can only
occur with the support of specific applications.  The purpose of this
course is to introduce you to the design and development of such
applications.  This course will expose you to the basic fundamentals of
the Internet and Web protocols, the different architectures that
Web-related applications use, and the programming languages that enable
the development of Web applications, placing particular emphasis on
JavaScript, HTML, XML, AJAX, and Java Server Pages (JSP).  We will also
cover matters of security and reliability in the development of web
applications via the use of transport encryption and authentication.
