**Unit 1: The Internet and Web Protocols** <span id="1"></span> 
**This unit begins with an overview of the development of the Internet
and the Web.  Students will then study Internet Protocols, focusing on
the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP), and the different methods by
which certain servers are able to perform requests over the Internet. 
The last section will address extensible Markup language, explaining how
it is used to present content on websites as well as how it can be used
to transport hierarchical data over the wire.**
