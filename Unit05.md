**Unit 5: JavaScript, Ajax, and Java Server Pages (JSP)** <span
id="5"></span> 
*This unit is the core of this course.  It will introduce you to the
three main programming languages used in developing web applications:
JavaScript, a dynamic language whose features are very similar to Java;
AJAX, a variation of XML; and Java Server Pages, a server-side java
technology that permits the creation of dynamically-generated webpages
with HTML, XML, or different document types to respond to a client
request to a Java Web Application container (usually a Web Server).*
