**Unit 3: Web Software** <span id="3"></span> 
**In this unit, you will learn the three software components that are
needed for the deployment and use of web applications: Web Browsers, Web
Servers, and Database Servers.  We will discuss the ways in which Web
Browsers display Web Application contents and the process of user input,
how Web Servers receive and process that user input, and how Database
Servers allow that information to be stored and retrieved. **

**Unit 3 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you 15 hours to complete.

☐    Subunit 3.1: 5 hours

☐    Subunit 3.2: 5 hours

☐    Subunit 3.3: 5 hours

**Unit3 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, students will be able to:

-   Demonstrate an understanding of Web Browsers.
-   Explain how Web Servers work.
-   Describe Database Servers.
