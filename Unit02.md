**Unit 2: Client Server Architecture** <span id="2"></span> 
**In this unit, you will learn about various types of Client-Server
Architectures and discuss how requests and responses are sent between a
client and server.  We will then learn about two-tier, three-tier, and
multi-tier architectures as well as the flexibility they bring to more
traditional Client-Server Architectures.**

**Unit 2 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you 15 hours to complete.

☐    Subunit 2.1: 5 hours

☐    Subunit 2.2: 5 hours

☐    Subunit 2.3: 5 hours

**Unit2 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, students will be able to:

-   Explain how Client-Server systems work.
-   Differentiate between two-tier and three-tier architectures.
-   Describe multi-tier architectures.

     Instructions: Review the presentation and take notes accordingly. 
    Note that Client-Server architecture is hierarchical; the server
    provides services to the client, in this case, web services.  This
    unit presents two Client-Server Architecture styles and demonstrates
    how their hierarchical architectures are divided.
